# istill.party (a lesson in creativity and a joke gone too far)

### Overview
Gather around while I paint a picture with my threads of golden word notes.

[Still there? - here is the deployed application](https://www.istill.party)

A few weeks ago I was interested in purchasing my own domain. I conferred with my good friend Marcus about the situation and he informed me that normal '.com' domains were for nerds and there were many much more exciting options available. I stumbled across countless options... and then I found '.party' (now is an important time to restate that I found .party and .party did not find me). I immediately made the joke about buying iusedto.party and istill.party. Well, there must have been something stellar about the moonlight that night or the tasty microbrews I was sluggin' because around 1am I bought them and commited to the joke.

At first, the website only contained a simple line and at most would result in a subtle exhale out of one, maybe two, nostrils.

This was good fun, but to be honest, was not fulfilling :( Fast forward a few weeks later and I had an idea to actually make something useful for this domain so I decided to create an app that would play a round of kings cup.

This domain has always been a virtual playground and only meant to foster creativity - not meant to offend anyone nor promote drinking.
